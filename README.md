# syscalls

syscalls.py automatically dumps all x64 ntdll syscalls and saves them all to `ntdll_syscalls.py`

how ntdll_syscalls.py will look like:

```python
# autogenerated ntdll syscall stubs

import ctypes

syscalls = {}

syscalls['NtOpenProcess'] = 0x23
syscalls['NtCreateFile'] = 0x55
syscalls['NtQueryInformationProcess'] = 0x26
syscalls['NtClose'] = 0x0F
...
```
